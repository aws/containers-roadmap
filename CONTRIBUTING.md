# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional 
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary 
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use issues to report bugs or suggest features.

If you're suggesting a new feature (i.e., functionality that doesn't exist yet), please use our issue template.  This will prompt you to answer a few questions that will help us figure out what you're looking for.  The template will also tag incoming issues with "Proposed".  This gives us a way to filter the community-opened issues quickly so we can review as a team.

If you want to see the list of proposed features, you can see the view [here](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/labels/Proposed).

Check for duplicates, though! When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20) issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. 


If you're reporting what you think is a bug (i.e., something isn't right with an existing feature), please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used (for something like Fargate or EKS, the platform version.  For ECS, the agent version)
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
